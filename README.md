# Godot Twitch Client
Lightweight GDScript wrapper for the Twitch API to send out HELIX requests or subscribing to topics on the EventSub.

## Installation and Usage
Add this repository to your Godot `addons` folder via `git submodule add https://github.com/DavidLokison/godot-gif-parser addons/twitch-client`. Make sure to `git submodule update --init --recursive` afterwards.

Then, add `res://addons/twitch-client/twitch_client.gd` to the global nodes in your Godot project settings.

To make EventSub subscriptions and HELIX request, you have to have a Twitch application client id. [to be defined...]
